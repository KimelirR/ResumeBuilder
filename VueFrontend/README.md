pnpm run dev

yarn dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
# npm
npm run build

# pnpm

Check out the [deployment documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) for more information.



## Image Build Steps

In order to package the app into a container you need to do a local build first



```bash
rm -rf node_modules .output yarn.lock
yarn add vite -D
yarn build
```

this will create  all the files and folders we deleted in the first command


Now you can run 
docker compose up -d or docker compose up --build -d
